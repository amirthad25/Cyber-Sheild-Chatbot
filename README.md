The CyberShield API is designed to assist users in obtaining information about cybersecurity tools provided by CyberShield. It answers questions about various tools, such as Phishing URL Detector, Password Strength Checker, Network Security Scanner, and more. This API is built using FastAPI and serves as a backend for interacting with users through a chatbot interface.

üöÄ Features
Chatbot Integration: Users can send a message (via GET or POST request), and the API will return predefined responses related to CyberShield tools.

Predefined Responses: The API includes a set of predefined responses that provide detailed information about each CyberShield tool.

User-friendly: The API is simple to integrate with various interfaces (e.g., web, mobile) for a seamless user experience.

You can use tools like Postman or Curl to test the API by sending a POST request with the user_message in the body.

Example using curl:
curl -X 'POST' \
'http://127.0.0.1:8000/chat' \

üí° How It Works
ChatRequest Model: The API receives user messages as input in the form of a POST request. It uses the ChatRequest model to define the structure of the incoming request, which expects the user's message as a string.
Predefined Responses: The API matches the user‚Äôs input with predefined questions about CyberShield tools. If there is a match, it returns the corresponding answer. If no match is found, it returns a default response indicating that more information is needed.

üåê Future Enhancements
Expand Responses: More cybersecurity topics and tools can be added to the predefined responses.
Integrate with NLP Models: Enhance the bot's ability to handle a broader range of user queries, improving its flexibility and usability.
User Authentication: Add user authentication to customize responses based on user preferences or previous interactions.
